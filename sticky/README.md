# Sticky Notes Web Application

A simple yet interactive sticky notes application that runs in a web browser. Users can create digital sticky notes for quick reminders, tasks, or jotting down ideas.

## Features

- Create and delete sticky notes.
- Drag and drop to reposition notes on the screen.
- Change the background color of each note.
- Choose different fonts for the text in each note.

## Current Issues

- **Lack of Design**: The current UI is basic and could benefit from a more aesthetically pleasing design.
- **Resizing**: The sticky note buttons are too cluttered, causing the resize functionality to be blocked by the dragging functionality.
- **Non-Persistent Notes**: Notes are not saved and will be lost upon refreshing or closing the browser.

## Ideas for Future Improvement

- **Font Size Adjustment**: Implement a feature to change the font size within notes.
- **Rich Text Formatting**: Allow different formatting within the same note, such as having one line in Arial with font size 12 and another in Times New Roman with font size 20.
- **Font Color Options**: Add functionality to change the text color within notes.
- **Persistence**: Implement local storage or database integration to save notes and retain them across sessions.
- **Improved Design**: Enhance the UI/UX design for a more engaging and intuitive user experience.
- **Note Categorization**: Add functionality to categorize or tag notes for better organization.
- **Shareability**: Enable notes to be shared between users or across devices.
- **Integration with Calendar**: Allow notes to be linked with dates and integrate with a calendar for reminders.
- **Accessibility Features**: Ensure the application is accessible, including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
